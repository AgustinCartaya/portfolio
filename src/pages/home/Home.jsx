      <Title>Biography</Title>

      <p>I am currently pursuing an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in Medical Imaging and Applications (MAIA), coordinated by the University of Girona, Spain, along with the Universit√© de Bourgogne, France, and the University of Cassino, Italy as partner universities. I am a research collaborator with Prof. Yongjian Hu's Lab at the South China University of Technology and Prof. Yu Guan at the University of Warwick, UK.
      I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan. Also, I got the chance to do a Summer of Code internship at JSK Lab, University of Tokyo, Japan, working on the prediction of robotics execution failures using deep learning models, with funding from Google.
      </p>

      <Title>Research Interests</Title>

      <p>I have broad interests in medical imaging analysis, deep learning, image processing, and natural language processing. My current research topics are about:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Image Registration</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Medical Image Analysis</strong><br />- breast mass detection and segmentation<br />- skin lesions detection<br />- diabetic retinopathy severity classification/lesions segmentation</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Learning with Low Supervision</strong><br />- weakly supervised image segmentation<br />- semi-supervised/unsupervised cross-domain image classification</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong><br />- sentiment analysis/emotion AI</p></li>
      </ul>
